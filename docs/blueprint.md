## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy Green (#77DD77) to evoke nature and growth, symbolizing the impact of donations. 
- Background color: Desaturated Light Green (#F0FAF0), a soft backdrop that maintains a connection to the primary color but keeps the interface airy and calm.
- Accent color: Muted Gold (#D4AF37) to highlight key interactive elements and emphasize transparency and value. 
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that balances a modern feel with approachability, making it suitable for both headlines and body text.
